# pi-stats

A tiny logging tool for the Raspberry Pi. It logs uptime, CPU activity, CPU temperature and memory stats. It's distributed in a binary format which weighs
less than 3 MB.

### Details

`pi-stats` runs in the background and probes for data every 5 minutes. By default, the data is saved on a daily log file and these daily logs are kept for 7 days 
before deletion. The logging can be swapped to a different system fairly easily like writing to a local or remote database instead of using local log files.

### Installation & Running

You can download the latest binary from Github [releases](https://github.com/levsthings/pi-stats/releases). You can then run the binary yourself or add it to your startup
routine via `systemd` or `rc.local`. The log outputs will automatically go to a directory named `.pi-stats`, and will be wherever the binary is run. If you add it to your
startup routine, pay attention to the execution context.


### Sample Output

```terminal
16:26:10, uptime: 8h27m14s, CPU 1: 16.98%, CPU2: 13.13%, CPU3: 18.00%, CPU4: 11.88%, temp: 36Â°C, memtotal: 15952MB, memused: 6103MB, memavailable: 9849MB
