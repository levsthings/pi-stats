# pi-stats


A tiny logging tool for the Raspberry Pi. It logs uptime, CPU activity, CPU temperature and memory stats. It's distributed in a binary format which weighs
less than 3 MB.


### Details

`pi-stats` runs in the background and probes for data every 5 minutes. By default, the data is saved on a daily log file and these daily logs are kept for 7 days 
before deletion. The logging can be swapped to a different system fairly easily like writing to a local or remote database instead of using local log files.


### Installation


You can download the latest binary from Github [releases](https://github.com/levsthings/pi-stats/releases). 


### Running


If ran without any flags, the program will write the data once to stdout and exit. If you supply the `--mode log` flag, the program will run
in it's intended background mode writing a log file every 5 minutes infinitely.

See usage:

```terminal
Usage of pi-stats:
  -mode string
    	Expected input: '--mode console' or '--mode log' (default "console")
```

You can run the binary yourself or add it to your startup routine via `systemd` or `rc.local`.The log outputs will automatically go to a directory named 
`.pi-stats`, and will be wherever the binary is run. If you add it to your startup routine, pay attention to the execution context.


### Sample Output


```terminal
16:26:10, uptime: 8h27m14s, CPU 1: 16.98%, CPU2: 13.13%, CPU3: 18.00%, CPU4: 11.88%, temp: 36Â°C, memtotal: 15952MB, memused: 6103MB, memavailable: 9849MB
```

### Replacing the formatter/logger


You can import `pi-stats` as a library and use the raw data to feed your own formatter and logger:

```go
package main

import pistats "github.com/levsthings/pi-stats"

func main() {
    data := pistats.GetData()
}
```
